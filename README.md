Reflections:
I am not happy with this as a finished product. I have completed all the goals but not all of the stretch goals.

although I accounted for localStorage being definied by useing OR || I was not able to find a place to use try catch and do not understand it

I included sound effects and images and even slight animation but I havent included al the images I would want as well as not having sound effects for all the actions I would want in the game

I did consolidate upgrades to an extent but was unable to fully consolidate for both sets of upgrades.

The volume control functions are messy and disjointed without clear signage to make it understandable whats doing what and I could have used notes or properly declared DOM elements to make it more semantically understandable by other devs.

I am very happy that I managed to optimise the page load going from a lighthouse score of less than 50 to 99
